Ziggy reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Ziggy.</P>
        <H3>Arbitration</H3>
        <P>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Ziggy&amp;s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above (&quot;Excluded Disputes&quot;), you agree that all disputes between you and Ziggy (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Ziggy, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&amp;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Ziggy hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims court&amp;s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Ziggy will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&amp;s account, if Ziggy is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Ziggy or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</P>
        <P>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Ziggy can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Ziggy in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: Email <a href={`mailto:${config.email.help}`}>{config.email.help}</a> to get more information.</P>
        <P>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Ziggy account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</P>
        <P>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Ziggy.</P>
        <H3>Time Limitation on Claims</H3>
        <P>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Ziggy must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</P>
        <H3>Entire Agreement</H3>
        <P>This Agreement is the entire agreement between You and Us regarding Your use of Services and Content and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the modification, amendment, or waiver is to be asserted. Furthermore, amendments to this agreement can be made and effected by us from time to time without specific notice to your end.
